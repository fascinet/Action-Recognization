# Action-Recognization
Refer this paper: Towards Good Practices for Very Deep Two 	Stream ConvNets.
	
	Model: Two stream ConvNets has been 	implemented in this model.
	For any input video, it provides the action class of the video.
	
	Dataset Used: UCF -101 Action Videos Dataset containing 101 	class.

	Output Score:  As in Paper (Approx due to less training).
